# WorkDayScheduler
A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day!

## Description
As an employee with a busy schedule, this application allows me to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. While I edit in tasks for a specific hour, I can use local storage to save the text so that even when refreshing my page, my tasks remain. Local storage was also used in this application to save all tasks, even if they are overwritten. All I have to do is check out the 'Application' tab while inspecting my page. Building this application was also a great way to work through my skills with Web APIs. The functionality of saving tasks called upon JavaScript logic and syntax while the design of the page applied knowlege of web APIs like jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and FontAwesome.

## Installation
Open the Index.html in Chrome or open the application link directly: [WorkDayScheduler](https://heatherloisejackson.github.io/WorkDayScheduler/)
